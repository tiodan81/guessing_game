# guessing_game

It's a guessing game made with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. The game asks the user to enter his/her name, then asks questions about me, the author. It can recognize correct, incorrect, and incoherent responses and ask the user to try again, and reports their final score at the end. If the user has answered any questions incorrectly, the game reports the correct answers to those questions.

Here's a joke for the TAs: How do you tell the difference between a girl clam and a boy clam?

Throw them against the wall. The one that yells, "Ow, my penis!" is the boy clam.

Added answer and result containers to HTML, and changed javascript to give feedback in the HTML.
